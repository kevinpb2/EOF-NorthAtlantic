# ATMS 523: Module 8 Project
The impacts of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on environmental conditions over the broader North Atlantic region are explored. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis is utilized to extract the dominant sea-level pressure pattern associated with the NAO. A correlation analysis is then conducted to investigate the relationship between the NAO and key environmental conditions, including precipitation and surface temperature. In addition, we'll briefly investigate the results of the EOF analysis and comment on the physical and statistical significance of our findings. Overall, this analysis reveals the importance of the NAO for influencing conditions over the North Atlantic, which has implications for planning and mitigation efforts over much of Europe.
