# ATMS 523: Module 8 Project
In this respository, we explore the impacts of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on environmental conditions over the broader North Atlantic region. The method of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis is utilized to extract the dominant sea-level pressure pattern associated with the NAO, which is found to be leading EOF mode. A correlation analysis is then conducted to investigate the relationship between the NAO and key environmental conditions, including precipitation and surface temperature. In addition, we'll briefly investigate the results of the EOF analysis and comment on the use of EOF analysis as a tool for dimensionality reduction in the Atmospheric Sciences. Overall, this analysis reveals the importance of the NAO for influencing conditions over the North Atlantic, which has implications for planning and mitigation efforts over much of Europe.
